# Wizards, Lawnmover & Hovercrafts
## Act 1 - Creativity
Creativity is not a category, it is a renewable resource, but it can run dry, if you run dry you can burn out
Technical ability is a skill
If you make things or stuff you are creative
Coding & Writing flex the same mental muscles

### Managaing your creative mana pool
Task Pairing - pair tasks that eat away with your creativity with ones that don't
Find your contrast

### Refilling your creative mana pool
Disengage - leave computer, step away and change perspectives, allow yourself to escape

## Act 2 - Perspective
Few things inspire change like perspective
Learn from masters
(Story about working at Radio Shack with his Boss that believed that Radio Shack was the pininacle of technology. Created a fake hovercraft website and tricked his manager. His perspective was too narrow)
Don't cling so hard you become a fool.

## Act 3 - People, process & product
### People
Always assume there is another side to the story
Don't be defensive. Listen
Don't gossip, it ruins companies
Treat others how you want to be treated
Culture change can be middle out (Pied Piper logo, haha)

### Process
Failure is an Event not a Person
If you are stuck. Change your perspective. Do things differently.
If you can't decide between two things ... nudge the donkey (A starving and dehydrated donkey right in the middle between food and water will die before it makes a choice)
Be realistic. Pace yourself

### Product
Present the truth in your product
Avoid superlatives & hyperbole
Actually use your product like a customer

## TL; DR version
Be Kind
Tell the Truth
Look for new perspectives
